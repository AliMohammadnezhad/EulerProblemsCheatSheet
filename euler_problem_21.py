# Amicable numbers
# Problem 21
# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
# Answer: 31626
#

def d(n):
    return sum(x for x in range(1, n // 2 + 1) if not (n % x))


s = set()
for i in range(1, 10000):
    m = d(i)
    n = d(m)
    if (i == n) and (m != n):
        s.add(m)

print( sum(s))
